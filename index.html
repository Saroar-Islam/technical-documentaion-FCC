                    <p>
                        In simple words, stock market is a marketplace where
                        company shares, securities, and other financial
                        instruments are bought, sold, and traded. It is a
                        collection of buyer and seller who trade stocks that
                        represent ownership interests in companies. The stock
                        market operates through a network of exchanges.
                        Companies issue shares of their stock on an exchange,
                        often to raise money to grow their business. Investors
                        invest in those companies through buying share of those
                        companies. Investors then buy and sell these stock among
                        themselves similar to trading in a market. The stock
                        exchange keeps track of supply and demand of every
                        listed stock. Supply and demand aid to determine the
                        price of every share. whenever the demand of a stock
                        goes high the price of that stock tends to rise, and
                        when the demand gets low and there is plenty of supply
                        the price of that stock tends to fall. Trading draws
                        investors with its promise of money and freedom,
                        challenge and excitement. But only way for an investor
                        or a trader to make profit is to predict the market,
                        when prices will go up and when prices will fall so he
                        or she can buy or sell this profitable stocks. But how
                        can an investor predicts a market that is constantly
                        shifting position ? Through analyzing the market, and
                        the factors that might affect the market. If an investor
                        go in blindly, without knowing which stock might be in
                        demand or in supply, and he might lose all his capital.

                    <p>
                        Fundamental analysis is a process of predicting
                        intrinsic value of an stock by examining related
                        economic and financial factors that could influence its
                        value in the future. Fundamental analysts study anything
                        that can affect a stock's value, from macroeconomic
                        factors such as the state of the economy and industry
                        conditions to microeconomics factors like the
                        effectiveness of the company's management. A fundamental
                        investor believes, the market price of a stock tends to
                        revert towards its intrinsic value. If intrinsic value
                        of a stock is over the current market price, the
                        investor would purchase the stock because he/she
                        believes that the stock price would rise and move
                        towards its intrinsic value. If intrinsic value of a
                        stock is lower than the market price, the investor would
                        sell the stock since he/she believes that the stock
                        price will fall and come closer to its intrinsic value.
                        To determine the intrinsic value of a company, the
                        fundamental analysis takes a top-down approach. It
                        involves analyzing shares of companies by first
                        analyzing the economy, then the industry, and then the
                        company itself.

                    <section class="sub-section">

                            Economic Analysis
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            In the first step of fundamental analyzing involves
                            the study of the overall economy. Here, main aim in
                            to determining if the economic climate is favorable
                            and capable of encouraging the growth of the
                            business sector, especially the capital market. If a
                            company is operating in a market condition that
                            support its operation economically and also will be
                            favorable in the future then the company's value
                            will also be growing. Therefore, to predict share
                            value, an investor has to spend time understanding
                            the forces operating in the overall economy.
                            Economic activities put an effect on corporate
                            profit, not directly through tax policies but also
                            through foreign policies and administrative
                            procedures, so it is essential to predict the
                            direction of the national economy. Zero growth rate
                            of an economy can cause to lower business profits,
                            which will result in a lower share price and
                            investors outlook of the company. Here are some
                            important factors that affect the overall economy:
                        </p>

                        <p class="bold-p">Economic Growth</p>
                        <p>
                            Economic growth is calculated by a country's Gross
                            Domestic Product (GDP) or Gross National Product
                            (GNP). The total value of final goods and services
                            produces within a year in known as GDP. Economic
                            growth increases production of goods and services in
                            a country, which increase the consumers spending.
                            The increase in sale results in firm increase their
                            investment spending and fund in hiring, which cause
                            more income in the of consumers, thus resulting more
                            spending.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bold-p">Interest rate and Inflation</p>
                        <p>
                            Interest rate is the cost at which consumer and firm
                            borrow money. When interest rate is low, people can
                            borrow more and can spend more, conversely when
                            borrowing rate is high people spend less money.
                            Inflation is the increase in price of overall goods
                            in an economy. When prices are too high, consumers
                            tend to lower their spending which results in firms
                            cutting back on investment spending. For this reason
                            interest rate is used to control inflation, if the
                            interest rate is high, people will be able to borrow
                            less money, spending will decrease as a result
                            economy will slow down and Inflation will decrease.
                            Conversely, if interest rate is low, people will
                            have more money to spend, which will result in a
                            growing economy and Inflation will increase.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bold-p">Unemployment</p>
                        <p>
                            Unemployment rates reflects the number of unemployed
                            person in the labor market. When the rate
                            unemployment rate is low more money will go to the
                            labor force, which will end up in consumers hand.
                            And more people will be unemployed less money will
                            to go the consumers, which will result in less
                            spending. And when recession which cause more
                            unemployment companies loses profit, consumers tend
                            to save than spending money because of constant fear
                            of losing jobs.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bold-p">Consumer Spending and Saving</p>
                        <p>
                            Employment and interest put an effect on consumer
                            confidence. If the future economic expectation is
                            high, consumer tend to spend more and save less.
                            Conversely when if future economic expectation is
                            low, consumers saves more and spend as little as
                            possible, which put as effect is companies sale.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bold-p">Capital Goods Market</p>

                        <p>
                            Capital goods are necessary to produce more consumer
                            goods. But investment in capital goods lower the
                            Standard of living in short run, cause resources are
                            use for capital goods instead of consumers goods.
                            This sacrifice can bring positive result in long run
                            when more consumer goods can be produces and
                            standard of living will improve as a result.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bold-p">Foreign Direct investment</p>
                        <p>
                            Foreign Direct investments have different effect on
                            different sectors of economy. If FDI flow in the
                            primary sectors is often puts a negative effect in
                            economic growth, but when FDI flow in the
                            manufacturing sector in put s a positive effect.
                            (Alfaro, 2003)
                        </p>

                        <p class="bold-p">Monetary Policy</p>

                        <p>
                            Monetary policy is mainly use for money supply.
                            Factor that monetary policy contribute to the
                            economic growth is price stability through with
                            different tools and money supply.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bold-p">Tax structure</p>

                        <p>
                            There is an argument both for and against higher tax
                            result in improve economic growth. Higher tax lead
                            to higher government investment which lead to better
                            infrastructure, improve R&D, and education, which
                            causes economy's production capacity. On the
                            contrary, higher tax prevent the incentive for
                            company to produce more or the individuals spend
                            more or supply more labor.

                        <p>
                            Some industry are linked with the economic growth,
                            and move along with the economy, such as
                            construction, manufacturing and banking industries.
                            These industries depend on the consumer spending.
                            When consumer spend more money they make more sale
                            and if consumers save more they tend to lose
                            business.

                        <p>
                            Contrary to the cyclical industries some industry
                            considered stable in their earnings, poor economic
                            condition doesn't affect them greatly because demand
                            of their goods or services are fairly stable.
                            Utilities, pharmaceuticals and fast moving consumer
                            goods are considered defensive.

                        <p>
                            Number of customers of an company vary from industry
                            to industry. Some Sector only supply its product to
                            a hand full of customers, while some has a millions
                            of customers. In term of losing customers those who
                            serve a few will be always in greater risk. A change
                            in economy or a change is tax will wipe out a large
                            amount of sale.

                            Market share indicates company's position in the
                            industry. A high volumes of share means the company
                            is one of the largest player in the market, which
                            will help it to dictate price of its own goods and
                            services as well as negotiate a good price with its
                            suppliers. Also company will be able to collect a
                            sizeable revenue in the industry when the industry

                            market growth. If there is no new customers, company
                            has to steal customers from its competitors to grow
                            its business. So analyst has to examine the industry
                            to determine its growth and also company's ability

                            of a company. Despite a company being in a growing
                            and promising industry it can fail to generate sales
                            or profit. Fundamental factors have a more active
                            role in determining company that has best stock
                            value. Fundamental factors can be grouped into two

                        <p>
                            When investors try to get a knowledge about
                            company's costs, sales and profit margin they look
                            at the income statement of a company. It gives them
                            the idea of company past performance also the growth
                            compare to the overall industry. Revenue growth and
                            earnings growth rate gives the investor the idea
                            about company ability to generate future earnings.
                            Balance sheet keeps track of all the asset and
                            liability of the company. From asset investor can
                            know how much cash flow a company generate within a
                            year. Investor feels confidence when a business
                            holds more cash on hand, as it protect the company
                            in case of poor market condition. To many
                            inventories gives the investor the idea that company
                            cannot generate enough sales, so inventories are
                            piling up. When a company's receivable is
                            increasing, it indicates company is failing to
                            collect payments from customers. And in case of bad
                            debt expense company will lose money. Here are some
                            ratios that investor calculate to get a better
                            picture of a company's fundamentals:

                            Liquidity ratios can tell an investor if the company
                            is able to pay of its short-term debt when they
                            arise and in a timely manner. Also it also give the
                            investor the idea about how efficiently a company
                            can convert its current assets into cash so that it
                            doesn't have to look for external capital. Basic

                                    Current assets are Cash and bank,

                                    easy to convert into cash which becomes a
                                    problem for company, for this reason company
                                    use the Quick Ratio. Usually 2:1 is the
                                    ideal ratio for the current ration, but it
                                    always vary from industry to industry.

                        commodities, fixed-income, currencies, and other
                        securities are evaluated with technical analysis. To use

                        that if one of its average climbs to an intermediate
                        high and another average also follow it within

                                sellers in the market, who believes the prices
                                will fall and they start selling.

                            <p class="bold-p">Support Levels</p>

                            <p>
                                Support level is specific level that is located
                                below the actual price level, if the price falls
                                and meet the support level, chances are high
                                that it will take a bullish direction and go up.
                                But if the price fall below the support level it
                                will continue to fall to the next lower support
                                level.
                            </p>

                            <p class="bold-p">Resistance Levels</p>

                            <p>
                                Resistance level located in the opposite
                                direction of support level. When the price goes
                                up and meet resistance levels, chances are high
                                that it will take a bearish turn. But same as
                                support level is the price break the resistance
                                level it rise till it meet a higher resistance
                                level.

                            <p class="bold-p">Simple Moving Average</p>

                            <p>
                                In technical analysis simple moving average
                                (SMA) is the most popular moving average that is
                                used by investors and analyst. Because of its
                                simplicity and it's very easy to use investor
                                and trader often use SMA over other tool to
                                identify tread direction, it can also be used to
                                generate potential buy or sell signals. <br />

                                SMA is the average or mean of combination of the
                                closing prices of certain time period then
                                dividing that with that same time period. To
                                understand it in a more simple term let's
                                assume, closing price of a stock for last 5 days
                                was: 70, 71, 65, 68, 70. Now add these prices
                                and divide that with time period, which is 5.
                                (70+71+65+68+70)/5= 68.8. SO 68.8 is the simple
                                moving average for last 5 days. <br />

                                SMA is commonly used for identify the trend
                                direction. If the SMA line is moving up which
                                indicate there is a upward trend, prices will
                                rise. And if SMA line is moving down, there is
                                downward trend and prices will fall.
                            </p>

                            <p class="bold-p">Exponential Moving Average</p>

                            <p>
                                Exponential moving average is similar to simple
                                moving average but it places more weight in the
                                recent data points, it called exponentially
                                weighted moving average. It reacts significantly
                                faster to recent price chances than SMA. Like
                                other moving averages EMA is best used for
                                indentify the direction of trend. So, traders
                                usually use EMA with other indicators to
                                determine the trend and measure the market
                                validity. Day traders or others who use intraday
                                information to analysis the fast moving market
                                often use EMA over other moving average for
                                their buying and selling decisions. When the EMA
                                is going up , traders consider there is a upward
                                trend, and when prices are going below EMA, it
                                considers as a downward trend. Moving averages
                                also helps to indicates support and resistance
                                level. The price action is supported by the
                                rising EMA, while resistance level of the price
                                action can be provided by a falling EMA. This
                                reinforces the strategy of buying when the price
                                is near the rising EMA and selling when the
                                price is near the falling EMA.

                            <p class="bold-p">Bollinger Bands</p>

                            <p>
                                Bollinger Bands are volatility indicator that is
                                drawn from one simple moving average and two
                                standard deviation for the purpose of
                                identifying extreme short-term prices chances.
                                The SMA moves along the price and two standard
                                deviation creates two outer bands, standard
                                deviation are used as it is the common measure
                                of volatility. Outer bands are created adding
                                and subtracting one standard deviation from the
                                moving average. Outer bands can also provide
                                support and resistance for a stock. If price is
                                about to hit one outer band usually it bounces
                                back to SMA or even to opposite outer band. When
                                the market is quiet meaning there is low
                                volatility outer bands come closer to the SMA. A
                                narrowing of the bands usually called Bollinger
                                Squeeze, traders use it as entry point before
                                markets gets volatile. When market gets volatile
                                outer bands spread far apart from one another. A
                                low volatility period generally followed by a
                                high volatility period and high volatility
                                followed by low volatility.

                            <p>
                                RSI is oscillator indicator that is developed by
                                J. Welles Wilder. It measure current price
                                strength in relation to previous prices to
                                evaluate if the stock is overbought or oversold.
                                RSI represented as a line that moves between 0
                                to 100, generally 30 or below is considered as
                                oversold and 70 or above is considered as
                                overbought. <br />
                                Traders can use RSI as a buy and sell signal, if
                                RSI cross above the oversold line a trader might
                                buy. and if the RSI cross below the overbought
                                line a trader might sell. RSI can also work as
                                divergences. Traders can also use RSI as buy
                                signal when price and RSI both in uptrend and
                                RSI cross below 50 line, conversely it can be
                                use as a sell signals when price and RSI both in
                                downtrend and RSI cross below 50 line

                    <p>
                        Besides the Fundamental and Technical analysis there is
                        another fairly new type of analysis that is called
                        Sentimental analysis. It is basically based on traders
                        opinions, market views and instinct. Every trader has
                        their own opinions and ideas about why market is moving
                        in a certain way and how will market react in the
                        future. When all the traders sentiment combine it
                        creates a new sentiment for the market. To understand
                        this market sentiment and trade based on that is
                        essentially sentiment analysis. Let's assume one single
                        trader thinks a certain stock will go bullish, but the
                        whole market is in the bearish mood, despite fundamental
                        and technical what analysis say market will go downward.
                        Same goes for if the market is in the bullish mood, and
                        a single trader thinks prices will fall, others will
                        make profit from the bullish market and that single
                        trader will lose money. So a trader has to combine
                        sentimental analysis with others tools to evaluate the
                        market.

                    <p>
                        As days passes number of investor and traders are
                        increasing rapidly. Everyone wants to make a profit in
                        the stock market but not everyone understand the market
                        or how it works. People blindly invest their money in
                        the stock market believing they will be able to predict
                        future stock price just by look at current price. And
                        there is another group of people do not know anything
                        about stock analysis and believe it does not work and
                        only way to predict the price is through inside
                        information, Main purpose of this paper is to give a
                        basic knowledge about the analyzing tools that traders
                        use as a daily basis to the new investors and traders.
                        Fundamental analysis and technical analysis was the main
                        focus here. Whenever we talk about analyzing tools a
                        comparison always comes between fundamental analysis and
                        technical analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fundamental analysis is best suited for long-term
                        investor who evaluate economy, industry and company to
                        determine the intrinsic value of a stock, where as
                        technical analysis is best suited for short-term market
                        analysis where trader uses charts and indicators to
                        determine the trends and price movements. But this does
                        not mean an investor only has to use one, often time
                        investors combine FA and TA to determine the best
                        possible decision. Fundamental analysis a time consuming
                        process, one has to evaluate all the fundamental factor
                        that could affect a company in anyway. So investors to
                        invest in long term can afford to use only FA. But
                        traders who invest for a very short term usually use TA.
                        Whether a trader is day trader, swing trader or position
                        trader without knowing the technical analysis he/she
                        won't be able to improve his/her performance in the
                        market. TA gives a trader all the current information
                        regarding a stock. TA's of the main assumption is market
                        discount all. A trader who has 10 minutes to make a
                        decision to sell or hold stocks can't afford the look
                        into the company's fundamental. Charts and indicators of
                        technical analysis will show that trade whether trend is
                        upward or downward, chances of prices movement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a trader there is different type of Charts and
                        indicator available. In line chart where it only shows
                        the closing price movement, and in bar and candlestick
                        charts where opening, high, low and closing all shows.
                        After choosing the preferable chart trader has the
                        option to determine which indicator to use. Some
                        indicator will tell the trend movement, some will give
                        the trend momentum, and some will indicate price
                        volatility and volume. One single indicator can never
                        provide a full picture, so trader use combination of
                        indicators to make their buying and selling decision.
